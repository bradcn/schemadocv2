        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when there is a reasonable belief that an individual&rsquo;s behavior may have a negative impact on the project or its community.
