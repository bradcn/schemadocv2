Setting up Schema Doc is quick and easy. You can choose from four different methods to get started with your documentation site:

### 1. Using CLI

The easiest and fastest way to get started with Schema Doc is by using npx. This method allows you to create a new Schema Doc project with a single command:

```bash
npx schemadoc@latest
```

This command will download the latest version of Schema Doc and guide you through the setup process.

### 2. Clone the Repository

If you prefer to have direct access to the project repository, you can clone it using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lisaorg/schema-document-template.git
```
```bash
cd schemadoc
```

After cloning, navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now you're ready to start customizing your documentation!

### 3. Use GitHub Template

Schema Doc is also available as a GitHub template. This method allows you to create a new repository based on Schema Doc without having to clone it manually:

i. Visit the [Schemadoc Github](https://github.com/lisaorg/schema-document-template)
ii. Click on "Use this template."
iii. Name your new repository and click "Create repository from template."

After creating your repository, clone it to your local machine and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
```

### 4. Use Replit Template 

Schema Doc can also be set up directly in Replit, making it easy to start coding right in your browser:

i. Visit the [Schema Doc Replit Template](https://replit.com/@amyssnippet/Schemadoc-Template?v=1#app/opengraph-image.jpg).
ii. Click "Use Template" to create a copy of the template in your Replit account.
iii. The project will open automatically in the Replit editor, and you can start working on your documentation right away.
